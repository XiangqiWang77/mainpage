I'm currently a Ph.D. student of University of Notre Dame CSE program. I have a profound interest in Graph Machine Learning and AI for Science topics, as well as fields including large language model. I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science @ University of Notre Dame, advised by Prof. [Xiangliang Zhang](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/xiangliang-zhang/). Prior to that, I was co-advised by Prof. [Huazheng Wang](https://huazhengwang.github.io/) and Prof. [Jian Kang](https://jiank2.github.io/), focusing on online bandit algorithm for graph diffusion. I spent wonderful time as an intern in USTC BASE research group mentored by Prof. [Qi Liu](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=5EoHAFwAAAAJ&hl=en) and Foxit company respectively. I have my Bachelor in Data Science degree from Univeristy of Science and Technology of China in Jun 2024.
